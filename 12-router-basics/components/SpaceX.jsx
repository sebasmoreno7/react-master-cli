                    SpaceX manufactures launch vehicles to operate its launch
                    provider services and to execute its various exploration
                    goals. SpaceX currently manufactures and operates the Falcon
                    9 Full Thrust family of medium-lift launch vehicles and the
                    Falcon Heavy family of heavy-lift launch vehicles â€“ both of
                    which powered by SpaceX's Merlin engines and employing VTVL
                    technologies to reuse the first stage.
