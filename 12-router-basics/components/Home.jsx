            Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to
            explore outer space. While the exploration of space is carried out
            mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration
            though is conducted both by unmanned robotic space probes and human
            spaceflight. Space exploration, like its classical form astronomy,
            is one of the main sources for space science.
